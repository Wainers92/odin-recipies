    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti and meatballs are a classic family-friendly dinner. This recipe is great for batch cooking so you can save extra portions in the freezer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 good-quality pork sausages</li>
        <li>1 kg beef mince</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>85g parmesan</li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic colves</li>
        <li>4 x 400g chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>125ml red wine</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Split the skins of the sausages and squeeze out the meat into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the mince, onion, parsley, parmesan, breadcrumbs, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together really well – the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, allowing about five per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin – the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep warm while you cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling, salted water.</li>
        <li>Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a few basil leaves, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
